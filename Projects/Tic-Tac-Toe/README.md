This is my first project after learning javascript
1. I learned many new topics while working on this project.
2. Initially, I struggled with the logic, but I managed to overcome it.
3. I faced some difficulties, but I didn’t give up—I resolved the issues and fixed the bugs.
4. I understood how arrays and functions work in real-time scenarios.
